This repo contains configuration files for my [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) + [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) ricing project and other useful configs. You may use my configuration, but in the current state it's mostly copied from Catppuccin's GitHub.

## Current config status

### Legend:
