## Introduction

This repo contains configuration files for my [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) ricing project using [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) Mocha theme. You may use my configuration, but in the current state it's mostly copied from Catppuccin's GitHub.

## Catppuccin theme configs

State of the theme configs for each package. Most packages didn't need modifications to the default Catppuccin Mocha theme configuration (config repos linked with each package), but changes to ones that needed and other useful info are detailed in this list.

- [bat](https://github.com/catppuccin/bat) - Default config (deleted unused theme files)
- [btop](https://github.com/catppuccin/btop) - Default config (deleted unused theme files)
- [cava](https://github.com/catppuccin/cava) - Default config
- [fish](https://github.com/catppuccin/fish) - Default config (deleted unused theme files)
- [gitui](https://github.com/catppuccin/gitui) - Default config (deleted unused theme files)
- [hypr](https://github.com/catppuccin/hyprland) - Colors applied manually in `hyprland.conf`
- [kitty](https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty) - Default config
- [mako](https://github.com/catppuccin/mako) - Changed border color and radius, added 5s timeout
- [qt5ct](https://github.com/catppuccin/qt5ct) - Changed accent color to green
- [rofi](https://github.com/catppuccin/rofi) - Deathemonic version. I'm using only the launcher, because I dont't need a runner, power menu or screenshot tool. I also had some problems with icons in those modules. I modified colors in `colors.rasi` to exactly match Catppuccin Mocha colors.
- [starship](https://github.com/catppuccin/starship) - Default config
- [swaylock](https://github.com/remiposo/swaylock) - Default config by [remiposo](https://github.com/remiposo). Labeled as WIP
- [waybar](https://github.com/catppuccin/waybar) - Colors applied manually in `style.css`
- [zellij](https://github.com/catppuccin/zellij) - Default config
